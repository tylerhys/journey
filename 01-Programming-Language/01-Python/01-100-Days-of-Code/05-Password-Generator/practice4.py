# You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game. 
# These are the rules of the FizzBuzz game:
#      Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn and include number 100.
#      When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".
#      When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".`
#      And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 it should print "FizzBuzz"

# Write your code here ðŸ‘‡
for i in range(1,101):
  if i%15 == 0:
    print("FizzBuzz")
  elif i%5 == 0:
    print("Buzz")
  elif i%3 == 0:
    print("Fizz")
  else:
    print(i)
